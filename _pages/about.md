Hello! I am a Ph.D. student at the UVR Lab at KAIST's Graduate School of Culture Technology (GSCT), where I am advised by Prof. Woontack Woo. Additionally, I earned my M.S. degree from GSCT at KAIST, under Prof. Woontack Woo's guidance. Before joining UVR Lab, I studied Visual Communication Design at SNU.

My primary research interest lies in enhancing the ways users perceive and interact with digital information on AR smartglasses. To achieve this goal, my current research focuses on exploring hybrid interfaces that combine AR smartglasses with other mobile devices.
