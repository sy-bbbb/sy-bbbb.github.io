Hello! I’m a Ph.D. student at the UVR Lab in KAIST's Graduate School of Culture Technology (GSCT), where I’m advised by Professor Woontack Woo. My research explores enhancing user perception and interaction with digital information on AR smartglasses, focusing on design of hybrid interfaces that integrates smartglasses with other mobile devices. I also hold an M.S. in Culture Technology from KAIST and a B.F.A. in Visual Communication Design from Seoul National University.
